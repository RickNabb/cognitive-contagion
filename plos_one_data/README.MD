`complex-param-sim-runs-analysis.csv`: Results of parameter sensitivity testing for complex (proportional threshold) contagion generated from the `complex-parameter-analysis` experiment in the NetLogo project's BehaviorSpace feature. This data supports the description of parameter testing in S1 Text.

`simple-param-sim-runs-analysis.csv`: Results of parameter sensitivity testing for simple contagion, generated from the `simple-parameter-analysis` experiment in the NetLogo project's BehaviorSpace feature. This data supports the description of parameter testing in S1 Text.

`simple-param-total-spread-analysis.csv`: Results of tests to see how long it took simple contagion to reach 90% of the network, across graph types. Data listed is the timestep, t, where more than 90% of the network adopted a given belief. This data supports S2 Table.

`graph-exp-correlations.csv`: Results of correlation tests for between-graph topology experiment data generated from the `graph-exp` experiment in the NetLogo project's BehaviorSpace feature. This data supports results in Table 2 of the main paper.

`influence-likelihood-paths_t-[1,2].[csv,xlsx]`:  Results of running the `influencer_paths_within_distance` function in `nlogo_graphs.py` on simulation data generated from NetLogo. Files ending with `.xlsx` are those which have been formatted and had some summary statistics performed on them to yield the results displayed in Table 4 of the main paper.
